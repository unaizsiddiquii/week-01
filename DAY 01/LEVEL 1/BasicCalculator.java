//Write a program to create a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should ask for two numbers (floating point) and perform all the operations

		float subtraction = number1 - number2;
		float multiplication = number1 * number2;
		float division = number1 / number2;
		
		System.out.println("The addition, subtraction, multiplication and division value of 2 numbers "+number1+" and "+number2+" is "+addition+", "+subtraction+", "+multiplication+", and "+division);
